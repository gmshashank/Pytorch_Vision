# [Session 1 - Test Accuracy of **50.0%** on the TinyImageNet dataset using ResNet18 model, Data Augmentations and OneCyleLR](Session1/README.md)

###	Objective:
Train a Neural Network with the following constraints:

1. Use your data loader, model loading, train, and test code to train custom ResNet model on TinyImageNet dataset
2. Apply data Transformations using Albumentations library
3. Implement LR Finder, ReduceLROnPLateau and find best LR to train model
4. Use One Cycle Policy
5. Use SGD with Momentum.
6. To achieve 50% Test accuracy.

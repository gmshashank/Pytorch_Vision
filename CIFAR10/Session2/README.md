## Overview

Train a Neural Network with the following constraints:

1. Use your data loader, model loading, train, and test code to train ResNet18 on Cifar10
2. The Target is to achieve 85% accuracy.

**Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition - (ResNet)**
 
Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. One big problem of a deep network is the vanishing gradient problem.
To solve this problem, the authors proposed to use a reference to the previous layer to compute the output at a given layer. 
In ResNet, the output from the previous layer, called residual, is added to the output of the current layer.
